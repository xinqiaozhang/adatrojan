Column Name,Explanation,Data Type
model_id,The unique identifier for each trained model. This value is used as the folder name within the released dataset. Models are numbered sequentially when generated before being split into the train and test datasets.,string
model_type,Whether the model is poisoned or clean.,"string in {clean, poisoned}"
arch,The type of Machine Learning architecture the model is.,"string in {nn, svm, rf}"
mal_ratio,"Proportion of malicious PDFs to make up the dataset (value of -1 leaves all the supplied data in their full amounts, which should be approximately evenly split between malicious and benign). Recommended to leave on -1.",integer
test_ratio,Proportion of files to be used in test set.,integer
dataset_size,"Number of PDFs to attempt watermark insertion for. If 10,000 is given, it will attempt to insert the watermark into 5,000 benign and 5,000 malicious samples.",integer
nn_layers,Number of layers (NN specific).,"integer in [2, 7]"
nn_activation_function,Activation function (NN specific).,"string in {tanh, sigmoid, relu}"
n_samples,Number of samples to use in SHAP computation. For NN recommended ~100. For SVMs use <=5 (time consuming). Not used for random forests.,integer
n_interpolations,Number of interpolations for SHAP computation (only for NN). Recommended ~50 ,integer
lr,Learning rate (NN specific).,float
epoch,Number of epochs (NN specific).,integer
optimizer,Optimizer (NN specific).,"string in {sgd, adam}"

svm_kernel,Kernel (SVM specific).,"string in {linear, rbf}"
rf_trees,Number of trees (RF specific),integer
poison_size,"Proportion of successfully watermarked benign samples to include in training set. Recommended 1.0 since the proportion of samples that are successfully watermarked is usually low. If 10% of samples are successfully watermarked, using 1.0 will give us a 10% poisoning rate.","float in [0, 1]"
trigger_size,Number of features to use in trigger.,"integer in [1, 30]"
attack_strategy,"Strategy for selecting features/values for the trigger. ""combined_shap"": Greedily select values associated with benign samples, ""min_population_new"": Target sparse regions of the feature space, ""argmin_Nv_sum_abs_shap"": blend in with dense regions of the feature space.","string in {combined_shap, min_population_new, argmin_Nv_sum_abs_shap}"
